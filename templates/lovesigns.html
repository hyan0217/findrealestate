            <br/>
            <p>Love comes attached with certain expressions, either as a small sweet smile, tears, a long stare, but all in all, when love occurs everything around us comes to a screeching halt. And we just take in the moment, feeling the vibrancy of the energy emanating from within our souls to the person or the thing that has made our heart squishy and helpless.</p>
            <p>But how do we know that he/she is the one, most of us have had the awe moment, only that it could be one-sided. And that is why we have the synchronicity signs to help give the last okay that indeed the feeling is mutual and that we are on the right path.</p>
            
            <h3>Love synchronicity signs</h3>

            <p>Synchronicity with a stranger leaves one with confused feelings, emotions, and questions; the most relevant question in this instance is what just happened or why did that happen. People will, therefore, feel like they know this person or, like they have met them before. So, what are the examples of the love synchronicity signs?</p>
            <p><b>Chance meetings-</b> the say that when you work hard, the universe will conspire to make you successful, the same goes for love. When you are ready to get back into the dating scene the universe will start throwing subtle signs, for example, you might start seeing or meeting someone that you had a romantic interest in.</p>
            <p>And for as much as it might not be indicative that you should be with that particular person, it is a sign that you are ready to move on and fall in love with someone else. In the above context, the universe is creating synchronicity by moving us to a love interest.</p>
            <p><b>Thinking about someone that you love, and they then get in touch-</b> thinking about someone that you are interested in romantically and then they call you can have you pour your heart out. And just like the chance meetings; thinking about your potential partner even if they aren’t the one, is a clear love synchronicity sign where the universe tries to synchronize your soul with the romantic world.<p>
            <p><b>Things tend to flow with a new partner-</b> after a long time out of the dating scene, new love might come your way, and you will even be surprised at how easily you fall in love, given how hard it was previously. Important to note is that there is no guarantee that the relationship will last, but you will definitely feel so much peace in the new engagement, but you might also quickly realize that the newfound love, doesn’t fit your expectations and opt-out to find what you truly desire and deserve.</p>
            <p>Things getting in tune with a new partner is a love synchronicity sign from the universe that you are ready to get back and the universe is, therefore, granting you your request.</p>
            <p><b>Repetitive messages–</b> the universe has a few subtle ways that it uses to get in touch with man, the most common method being the use of the angel numbers, the angel signs, and the repetitive messages through the songs that we listen to on the radio or the words and phrases that keep popping up on TV shows. The above are, therefore, used to remind us to pay attention to our immediate environment.</p>
            <p>For love synchronicity, the messages may, therefore; come in the form of music, a song that we love and listen to most of the time and one that has a love message. When it is played randomly but repetitively then the universe is trying to reach out to you, beckoning you to be conscious of your immediate surroundings as love is in the air.</p>
            <p><b>Intuition-</b> well sometimes, we tend to get an abrupt feeling of happiness, we feel like our hearts have become light, but we can barely put a finger, on what exactly is making us happy. The above is a synchronicity sign that something good is about to happen, maybe a job promotion, you could be about to land a major deal or love is coming your way.</p>
            <p>Synchronicity signs are not always positive and in certain cases, you will feel like your stomach is making small knots rapidly, this could be a sign that the relationship you are in is about to end. The above comes when an individual gets a heavy feeling in their hearts and stomach, other times they could be in a relationship but then they get a gut feeling that things are not right, thus become quite uncomfortable.</p>
            <p>The above is the universe’s way of telling you that you need to get out of the relationship and move on because love is no longer being served.</p>
            <p><b>Feelings of joy and contentment-</b> there is no possible way that anyone can be truly happy without inner peace, so once you let go off the negativity and bad experiences of the past, you automatically start attracting good positive vibes. Inner happiness means that you have gotten things under control and you now have to be more conscious of your environment. Happiness and contentment are sure signs that love is coming your way and that you are on the right track.</p>
            <p><b>Dreams-</b> the universe also reaches out to man through repetitive dreams. So, as regards love, you could be seeing a particular person over and over in your dreams, either a stranger or someone from your past or present. The above is a love synchronicity sign that you need to be conscious of and start to decipher its meaning because it has the potential of influencing your future life.</p>

            <p><b>Random repetition meetings-</b> in love synchronicity the universe will present you with an individual that has an eye on you or vice versa, and by coincidence, you will be awkwardly bumping into one another. And while the first encounters might seem random when it becomes repetitious then it should no longer be considered a coincidence. You should, therefore, be aware and act accordingly because the universe is responding to your request for love or sustainable courtship with a promising future.</p>
            
            <h3>Tips to help keep in touch with the synchronicity signs</h3>

            <p>•	Create a journal about the signs that pop up- anytime that you notice a repetitive sign, you need to do your best and keep track of them. Write down the meaning of a particular synchronicity sign and the meaning that you think you derive from it. Then watch out it if continues to be repetitive.</p>
            <p>•	Do not dismiss the signs that come to you in your dreams, more so if they are repetitive, conscious dreaming does have meaning to your life.</p>
            <p>•	Ensure that you always have a clear mind, meditate, don’t hold on to negativity, and don’t be obsessed with money. The above will only make it hard for you to notice the synchronicity signs, and besides, there is no good that one can attract with a negative attitude or mind.</p>
            <p>•	Stay curious- any time that a sign shows up, you must always pay attention and try to decipher its deeper meaning to see if you can apply it to your life. You never know if it will open up to synchronicity and besides there is no harm in trying.</p>
            <p>•	If the feeling is right, don’t let this opportunity slip past you, follow it up, let the universe know that you are alert, to notice the additional synchronicity signs, which will be made clear to you.</p>
            <p>•	Remember also, that you cannot see signs unless there is an area in your life that needs to be addressed. You will, therefore, evaluate the various aspects of your life, and see where your attention is being pulled to and whether the first sign has any relation or meaning to the questions that you have been asking.</p>
            <p>•	The universe is very subtle, individuals, therefore, need to be extra keen, if you don’t notice any synchronicity sign, don’t give up rather keep looking, as the synchronicity signs are bound to bring magic to your life.</p>
