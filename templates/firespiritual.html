            <h2>Fire Spiritual Meaning</h2>
            <p>In life fire does three important things, it illuminates, it provides warmth in the cold season, and consumes, leaving only ashes behind. But when it comes to symbolism, fire is inspirational, and we have also found it to be quite dominant in the Bible painting the picture of the existence of hell. Now fire is also among the elements that man has been able to produce independently, and you will, therefore, find certain rituals being performed with fire. 
            <b>In the spiritual realm fire could mean sexuality and is therefore associated with the famous line “ Light My Fire…,” fire can also mean enlightenment or fertility.</b> When talking about the spiritual meaning of fire, we cannot fail to mention the various religions on earth and how they regard fire. The Chinese, Christians, and Hebrews, therefore regard fire as a symbol of divinity, for Christians however, the meaning of fire extends to embrace knowledge and wisdom.</p>

            <h3>Spiritual meaning of fire as presented in the bible</h3>

            <p>In the various books of the bible, fire is used to symbolize so many things, as we will discuss below but most of the time, it is mentioned where there is a transformation, where the old dies through fire and a new thing is born either in spirit or physically. <b>Fire has also been used to express anger</b>; in Isaiah 66:15 we are told that the Lord will come in fire, and his chariots just like the whirlwind he will render his anger in fury, and the rebukes will come in the form of flames of fire.</p>
            <p><b>Fire has also been used to symbolize death-</b> a fact that has been depicted in Leviticus 22: 19, where it says, that the daughter of any priest, who profanes herself by whoring, profanes her father and she shall, therefore, be burned with fire. The verse discourages immorality and as such the punishment is being burned by fire, the latter automatically send a strong message to those wishing to take that particular route, to refrain.</p>
            <p>In Amos 2:2- we hear the Lord saying that he will send fire upon Moab, to devour the strongholds of Kerioth and Moab, who shall die amid the uproar, the shouting, and the sound of trumpets. And still, in Amos 1:12, the Bible depicts the use of fire in destruction, where it says “he will send a fire upon Teman, where it shall be used to devour the strongholds of Bozrah.</p>
            <p>And the most common depiction of fire that most people can and have been able to relate to is in the book of Mathew 18: 8, and here we see fire being used to warn people against sinning. And it, therefore, goes ahead and says that if the hand or the foot causes one to sin, then it should be cut and thrown away and that it is better to live your life as a cripple than with all your faculties and then end up being thrown into eternal fire.</p>

            <p><b>Fire as a symbol of power-</b> In Daniel 7:9 says, and that as the ancient of days took his seat, his clothing was without stain, and the hair on the head seemed like pure wool, and his throne, was fiery flames, and its wheels were burning with fire.</p>
            <p>Other depictions of power are in Leviticus 9:24, where God proves his might when he sends down fire to consume the burnt offering and the pieces of fat at the altar. The above-left people in awe as their faith in God grew evident by how they shouted and fell on their faces. Exodus 19: 18 says that Mount Sinai had been wrapped in smoke, because the Lord had descended on it with fire, and the smoke went up as the Mountain trembled.</p>
            <p>From the above fire can be used to symbolize different things and it, therefore, just depends on the context. <b>Fire can, therefore, be used to symbolize, Rebirth or resurrection</b>, take the example of the forest fires, or the controlled fires of California which help get rid of the old and dried vegetation to give space for the new vegetation to emerge.</p>

            <p><b>Fire can also symbolize passion and desire-</b> a good example would be depicted from Shakespeare's words where he says, that his drops of tears will be turned into sparks of fire.</p>
            <p><b>Fire symbolizes destruction-</b> apart from symbolism fire actually destroys things and it never gets satisfied, it will, therefore, go on and on for as long as there is something to burn. Besides the easiest way of destroying anything and ensuring that it completely vanishes from the surface of the earth is through fire, where things are normally reduced to fine ashes.</p>
            <p><b>Fire symbolizes eternal destruction-</b> it is impossible to talk about hell without linking it with fire, or rather eternal fire. The bible tells of the evildoers burning in hell, but this time it is not being referred to as consuming but rather as a form of eternal torture. In the book of Revelation, the bible condemns the false prophets and the idol worshipers, and it goes ahead and says that sinners will be cast alive into a lake of burning fire, with brimstone.</p>

            <h5>Interesting Fire Rituals in Different Cultures</h5>
            <br/>
            <h5>Chinese-Burning of fake money in Funerals</h5>

            <p>Did you know that the Chinese believe in life after death and in that same vein they have always given their departed a perfect send-off by burning fake money at their funerals. The mourners are, therefore, in the habit of burning joss paper which also goes by the name ghost money. So in China, there is folklore that says that if they burn paper money and proceed to make offerings at the graves of their ancestors, the deceased will receive the money and live a prosperous afterlife.</p>
            <p><b>India-</b> Hindu Priests in Mundur India have held on to an age-old tradition, where they perform a 12-day fire ritual which involves the chanting of hymns and making offerings to the sun god; and as they do this they also pray for a world that is free of negative energy.</p>
            <p>What’s more is that in most of the Hindu homes, you will find a lamp burning at the altar, and which symbolizes the search for enlightenment and lusture in life. The above is thanks to the one Shloka in Bhagwad Geeta where Krishna talks of the lamp, and which says that “ the lamp that is placed in a windless place will burn steadily without flickering, The smile can, therefore, describe the Yogi whose mind is controlled and who is absorbed in the self of me.</p>
            <p>According to Krishna such a mind is radiant and meditation and perceives the self of me, the long and short of the above script is that the fire flame is compared to the human spirit which after enlightenment, it is brought closer to divinity and salvation.</p>
            <p><b>Cultural burning in California-</b> in the California landscape fire is not a new thing, the Native American tribes, therefore, held the controlled burns, which were held at least once a year with the aim of clearing out the underbrush while encouraging new plant growth. California is prone to wildfires, thanks to the thick vegetation that dried out in summer, which then created the kindling fires that have over time destroyed the communities in California.</p>
            <p>So what happens is that the government partners with the locals to participate in controlled burning, which according to the tribes within it is a good chance for them to carry out the age-old traditional burning in their ancestral land.</p>
            <p><b>Fire ceremonies–</b> sounds eventful and indeed they are; for the longest time people have danced around open bonfires, a ritual that is mainly performed as the night gets older. The San people of Southern Africa have for a long time been known for dancing around the communal fires, a thing that is done as part of their healing ceremonies.</p>
            <p>And for as much as the fire ceremonies might be considered rituals they do have positive benefits to the participants, as they help to raise awareness of the overall health and well-being benefits, of participating in traditional dancing, drumming, and singing.</p>
