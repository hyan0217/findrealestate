            <p>Life path 7 individuals <b>don’t go by the set society standards</b>, rather they have their own devised methods, beliefs, and principles, that makes them explorers, mystic’s, and spiritual beings. The 7’s relate peace with being alone; they are, however, full of surprises when it comes to their personality, as they love self-discovery and despite their high demand for privacy they do have an attractive personality thus possess a magnetic charm.</p>
            <p><b>They also like to boast</b> and you will find them showing off their skills, their sense of humor is ripe, and love to spend time with their dear ones. The life path 7 individuals will spend time with people, have fun, but getting their alone time is like a pill that must be swallowed after being with people, which we must say is quite therapeutic, as it provides the opportunity to reflect on things, analyze and evaluate situations, and finally come up with solutions for the various issues.</p>
            <p>And given that they rarely entertain people in their personal space, the <b>7’s tend to be even more protective of their inner self;</b> you can also expect them to have a hard time trusting people, and are always skeptical about almost everything. 7’s are also famous for blowing things out of proportion, and will, therefore, become very suspicious of things around them most of which don’t have any element of truth.</p>
            <p>These individuals have been created in such a way that they can out of nowhere become gloom-ridden, and somehow selfish, a thing that puts a strain on their relationship creating some form of distance between them and other people. And for as much as the 7’s love their solitary lives; they are also envious of socially active people.</p> 
            <p>They, however, have a hard time connecting with other people a thing that they don’t try so hard to do. And the best thing about them is that they have the ability to attain wisdom and knowledge, and which they do relentlessly, 7’s are knowledgeable thus good at analyzing situations in a sensible manner, which then helps them grow, nurture and evolve, in a way that makes them gain a deeper understanding about spirituality and humanity.</p>
            <p><b>Love and relationships–</b> 7’s are very sensitive in nature, and that is why some of them prefer to lead an unmarried life. For those in marriage, they tend to be very serious in making it work, they do possess the real true love, and the love is all-round especially for their children, interestingly is that they don’t feel the same love for the children that aren’t theirs.</p>
            <p>7’s are in for the long term when it comes to marriage and they will make one envious, given their ability to present very successful marriages, and a tight family unit. They have a small circle of friends who get the best of them and will most of the time pair up with people who can tackle difficult situations. They are also not very good at saving money and love to tour other countries.</p>
            <p>When they find compatible partners, life path 7’s can make a good family life and home, but the opposite will most of the time result in divorce.</p> 
            <p><b>Jobs and professions–</b> The life path 7 individuals love jobs that allow them to make independent decisions, and will also do jobs that offer them an opportunity to tour other foreign countries.
