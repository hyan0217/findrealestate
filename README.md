# WEATHERING CLOUDS
####  Youtube video instructions
#### Description: 

I started this project with Flask in mind due to week 9s project. I wanted to build my own Flask app entirely from scratch with two different APIs and a section with manifestation articles.

First up is NASAs own API. I was able to grab the Image of the Day based on the current day.

Next, I used IPAPIs API to extract the users latitude and longitude location to implement into my weather app.

The weather app uses OpenWeatherMaps Dark Sky API to extract the current temperature, UV, humidity, wind speed, Feels like, Cloud movements along with a 7 day forecast.
